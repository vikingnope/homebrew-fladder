# Homebrew Fladder Tap

Unofficial Homebrew tap for [Fladder](https://github.com/DonutWare/Fladder) - A Simple Jellyfin frontend built with Flutter.

## What is Fladder?

Fladder is a modern, cross-platform Jellyfin client that provides:
- 🎬 Media streaming with Direct, Transcode, and Offline playback
- 📱 Support for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android, and Web
- ⚡ Trickplay support with timeline scrubbing
- 🎨 Dark/Light mode with multiple color themes
- 📚 Simple comic book format reading (.cbz, .cbr)
- 💾 Download and sync content for offline viewing
- ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts for desktop platforms

## Why This Tap?

Fladder's macOS builds are not code-signed with an Apple Developer certificate, which means they cannot be included in the official Homebrew Cask repository. This tap provides an easy way to install and manage Fladder on macOS using Homebrew.

## Installation

First, add this tap to Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap vikingnope/fladder
```

Then install Fladder:

```bash
brew install --cask fladder
```

Or do both in one command:

```bash
brew install --cask vikingnope/fladder/fladder
```

## First Launch

Since Fladder is not code-signed, macOS will block it on first launch. To bypass the unidentified developer warning:

**Method 1: Right-click + Control**
1. Locate Fladder in your Applications folder
2. Right-click the application and click "Open" while holding `Control`
3. Click "Open" in the security dialog

**Method 2: System Settings**
1. Try to open Fladder normally (it will be blocked)
2. Open `System Settings > Privacy & Security`
3. Scroll down to the Security section
4. Click "Open Anyway" next to the Fladder warning

After this first time, you can launch Fladder normally from Launchpad or Applications.

## Updating

To update Fladder to the latest version:

```bash
brew upgrade fladder
```

## Uninstalling

To remove Fladder:

```bash
brew uninstall --cask fladder
```

To completely remove Fladder including all app data and preferences:

```bash
brew uninstall --zap --cask fladder
```

To remove this tap:

```bash
brew untap vikingnope/fladder
```

## What Gets Removed with `--zap`?

The `--zap` flag removes:
- `~/Library/Containers/nl.jknaapen.fladder` - App data and preferences (142.9 MB)
- `~/Library/Application Scripts/nl.jknaapen.fladder` - Sandboxed scripts
